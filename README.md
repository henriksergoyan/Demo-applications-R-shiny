# Demo-applications-R-shiny
Developed for Ministry of Economy of Armenia.

Under this repository there two of my projects which I have done in Ministry of Economy of Armenia.
All codes are written in R. 

**Required packages:**
stringr
utf8
ggplot2
shiny
shinydashboard
rsconnect
dplyr
writexl

## Project 1 (Filtering)

The function of this shiny application is to manipulate the data downloaded from [Armstat](armstat.am).
At first user is browsing the data of products and their codes and price as it was downloaded,
then he/she is browsing main file which contains all
codes of products for not missing any product. After that user will be able to choose year according to the
data which you inputed at first.
User can also download the filtered data.
<br>
The automation of that process was critically important for the Statistics
department of Ministry of Economy of Armenia because the data in Armstat is being updated every month.

## Project 2 (Final project)

The language of application is Armenian. The application's main function is to collect and store huge amount of information and then give users the ability to search, filter, clean the data and also make interactive plots according to it. The test datas are attached to the folder.
