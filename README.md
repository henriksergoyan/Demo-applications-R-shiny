# Demo-applications-R-shiny
Developed for Ministry of Economy of Armenia.

Under this repository there are some of my projects which I have done in Ministry of Economy of Armenia
All codes are written in R. 

## Project 1 (Filtering)

**Required packages:**
stringr
utf8
ggplot2
shiny
shinydashboard
rsconnect
dplyr
writexl

The function of the application is to manipulate the data downloaded from [Armstat](armstat.am).
At first user is browsing the data of products and their codes and price as it was downloaded,
then he/she is browsing main file which contains all
codes of products for not missing any product. After that user will be able to choose year according to the
data which you inputed at first.
User can also download the filtered data.

The automation of that process was critically important for the Statistics
department of Ministry of Economy of Armenia because the data in Armstat is being updated every month.
